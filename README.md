## 4. Implementation Process
### Step 1: Extract Brand Assets
From the Brand Resource Pack, I'll identify:

Creating wireframe mentally, then implementing with Claude Code:

- Header with navigation
- Hero section with full viewport height
- Services in a 2x2 grid (desktop) or 1x4 (mobile)
- Portfolio with filterable items
- Process visualization
- Contact form

###Step 4: Development with Claude Code
Generating:

- HTML5 structure
- CSS3 with Flexbox/Grid

- Responsive breakpoints

### Step 5: Testing & Refinement
Cross-browser testing

- Mobile responsiveness check
- Performance optimization
- Content refinement

## 5. Expected Deliverables
###Primary Output:
- HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- Screenshots of desktop and mobile views
- Process documentation in this format

### Technical Specifications:
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks for simplicity)
- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)

Accessibility considerations (ARIA labels, contrast ratios)

Performance optimized (minimal assets, efficient code)
